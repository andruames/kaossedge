		<ol>
			<li><a href="album1.html">HARD AS FUCK</a> [kranial] - our first album. pretty rough</li>
			<li><a href="album2.html">DOG</a> [kranial] - features Krank's dog Borkavitch. pretty ruff</li>
			<li><a href="album3.html">INSECTLIKE HUMANOID</a> [skeletal] - first album with skeletal. hate those guys</li>
			<li><a href="album4.html">ONLY HALF OF US ARE HUMAN</a> [skeletal] - Malcon left the band because we didn't play fast enough. maybe our worst album</li>
			<li><a href="album5.html">SLIME MAN</a> [konfrontation] - sans Malcon, featuring the guy from Decapitators. forget his name</li>

			<li><a href="album6.html">RUINS2RUINS</a> [larry's world] - this one was a solo project. Kaoss Edge had kinda fallen apart </li>
			<li><a href="album7.html">INSANITIZER</a> [larry's world] - got the whole band back together. title track was our biggest hit</li>
			<li><a href="album8.html">BREAKSLIME</a> [larry's world] - had the singles 'absorber' and 'expose the freak'</li>
			<li><a href="https://soundcloud.com/konfrontationrecords/sets/platitudes-2015">PLATITUDES</a> [konfrontation] - special project for konfrontation records, only had 2 songs 'looking glass' and 'apparitions'. some of my personal favorite Kaoss Edge</li>
			
			<li><a href="album9.html">BIOCONFUSED</a> [larry's world] - slimiest record yet. got some of the sound we were going for on SLIME MAN but with Malcon's shredding</li>

			<li><a href="gate.html">FRIDGEHEAD</a> [kranial] - hasn't been released yet. going to blow some minds. or freeze them</li>
